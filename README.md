Read this presentation: [https://goo.gl/KukCHv](https://goo.gl/KukCHv) to learn more.

## Development

Clone this, repo, then from within the checkout folder run:
```
npm install
```

In a new tab, run:
```
npm start
```

This should open `http://localhost:3000/diplo/` in a browser; this can be debugged using react tools.

In another new tab, run:
```
node server.js
```

This will start up the server needed to serve dynamic data to the react application.

## Production

This process has not been defined yet.
